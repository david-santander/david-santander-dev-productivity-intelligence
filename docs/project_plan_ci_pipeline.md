# Containerized CI Pipeline: Gitea, Jenkins & SonarQube - Project Plan

## I. Information Gathering and Clarification:

1.  **Read the BRD:** Thoroughly review the provided BRD to fully understand the project requirements, scope, and constraints.
2.  **Clarifying Questions:** Ask the user clarifying questions to address any ambiguities or gaps in the BRD.

    *   Python/Django Application: Should I create a very basic Python/Django application, or do you have a specific application in mind?
    *   Gitea Version: Should I use the latest stable version of Gitea, or is there a specific version you'd like me to use?
    *   Jenkins Plugins: Besides the SonarQube Scanner and Gitea plugin (or generic Git SCM), are there any other Jenkins plugins you'd like me to include?
    *   Setup Automation: Should I focus on providing clear, step-by-step instructions for the initial setup, or should I explore Jenkins CasC (Configuration as Code) or Groovy init scripts for Jenkins automation?

## II. Project Planning and Design:

1.  **High-Level Architecture Diagram:** Create a Mermaid diagram illustrating the interaction between Gitea, Jenkins, and SonarQube.
2.  **Component Breakdown:** Detail the configuration and setup steps for each component (Gitea, Jenkins, SonarQube).
3.  **Artifact Generation:** Outline the process for generating the required artifacts: `docker-compose.yml`, `Jenkinsfile`, `sonar-project.properties`, sample Python/Django application, and setup instructions.
4.  **Risk Assessment and Mitigation:** Review the identified risks and propose mitigation strategies.

## III. Implementation and Artifact Creation:

1.  **Docker Compose Configuration:** Define the services, networks, and volumes in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
2.  **Jenkins Pipeline Definition:** Create the `Jenkinsfile` with stages for checkout, SonarQube scan, and result publishing.
3.  **SonarQube Project Configuration:** Generate the `sonar-project.properties` file with project key and source directory settings.
4.  **Sample Python/Django Application:** Develop a basic application structure with placeholder code.
5.  **Setup Instructions:** Document the steps for setting up Gitea, Jenkins, and SonarQube, including user creation, token generation, webhook configuration, and pipeline job creation.

## IV. Testing and Validation:

1.  **Deployment:** Launch the stack using `docker-compose up`.
2.  **Initial Setup:** Perform the documented setup steps.
3.  **Trigger Scan:** Commit and push code to the Gitea repository to trigger the Jenkins pipeline.
4.  **Verify Results:** Check the SonarQube dashboard for scan results.
5.  **Persistence:** Restart containers and verify data persistence.

## V. Documentation and Refinement:

1.  **Review Documentation:** Ensure the setup instructions are clear and complete.
2.  **Refine Artifacts:** Improve the `docker-compose.yml`, `Jenkinsfile`, and `sonar-project.properties` based on testing results.

## VI. Finalization and Delivery:

1.  **Write Plan to Markdown:** Write the detailed plan to a markdown file.
2.  **Request Mode Switch:** Request the user to switch to another mode to implement the solution.
