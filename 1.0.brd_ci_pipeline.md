# Business Requirements Document (BRD)

**1. Project Title:** Containerized CI Pipeline: Gitea, Jenkins & SonarQube for Automated Python Code Scans

**2. Date:** 5/22/2025

**3. Version:** 1.1

**4. Project Overview & Purpose:**
This project aims to create a fully containerized, automated code quality analysis pipeline. The system will include new instances of Gitea, Jenkins, and SonarQube, all running in Docker containers orchestrated by Docker Compose. Jenkins will be configured to monitor a sample Python/Django Gitea repository (to be created as part of the setup) and trigger a SonarQube scan every time a commit is pushed to its `main` branch. The goal is to provide a self-contained, reproducible environment for continuous code quality feedback.

**5. Business Objectives & Goals:**

* **Improve Code Quality:** Proactively identify and encourage remediation of code smells, bugs, and vulnerabilities in a sample Python application.
* **Early Issue Detection:** Catch potential issues early in the development lifecycle within the sample project.
* **Automate Quality Gates:** Establish an automated process for code analysis.
* **Provide a Replicable Demo Environment:** Offer a complete, containerized setup for demonstrating CI/CD and code quality practices.
* **Centralized Reporting:** Leverage SonarQube's dashboard for a unified view of code quality metrics for the sample project.

**6. Scope:**

**6.1. In Scope:**

* **Container Setup (Docker Compose):**
  *   Creation of a `docker-compose.yml` file to define and run Gitea, Jenkins, and SonarQube services.
  *   Containerization of a Gitea server (latest stable version).
  *   Containerization of a SonarQube server (latest stable Community Edition).
  *   Containerization of a Jenkins master (latest stable LTS version).
  *   Configuration of persistent volumes for Gitea, Jenkins, and SonarQube data to ensure data survives container restarts.
* **Gitea Configuration:**
  *   Initial setup of the Gitea instance (e.g., admin user).
  *   Creation of a sample user (e.g., `test-user`).
  *   Creation of a sample Gitea repository under the `test-user` (e.g., `django-sample-app`).
  *   Seeding the `django-sample-app` repository with a basic Python/Django application suitable for SonarQube analysis.
  *   Configuration of a Gitea webhook on the `django-sample-app` repository to trigger Jenkins on `main` branch commits.
  * Generation of a Gitea access token for Jenkins to clone the repository.
* **SonarQube Configuration:**
  *   Initial setup of the SonarQube instance (e.g., admin user).
  *   Generation of a SonarQube authentication token for Jenkins to publish scan results.
  *   Definition of a SonarQube project key for the sample application (e.g., `dev.productivity:django-sample-app`).
* **Jenkins Configuration:**
  * Initial setup of the Jenkins instance (e.g., admin user, necessary plugins like SonarQube Scanner, Gitea plugin if beneficial).
    * Secure storage of the Gitea access token and SonarQube authentication token within Jenkins credentials.
    * Creation of a Jenkins Declarative Pipeline (Jenkinsfile) stored in the Gitea repository (`django-sample-app`).
    * The Jenkins pipeline will:
      * Be triggered by Gitea webhooks.
      * Checkout code from the `django-sample-app` Gitea repository's `main` branch.
      * Execute a SonarQube scan using SonarScanner for Python. This will involve a `sonar-project.properties` file in the Gitea repository.
        * Publish scan results to the SonarQube server.
* **SonarScanner Configuration:**
  * Creation of a `sonar-project.properties` file within the sample Python/Django application to configure the scan (e.g., project key, source directories).
* **Documentation:**
  * Instructions for setting up and running the entire stack using `docker-compose up`.
    * Steps for accessing Gitea, Jenkins, and SonarQube dashboards (e.g., default URLs, ports).
    * Guidance on how to trigger the first scan (e.g., by making a commit to the sample Gitea repo).

**6.2. Out of Scope:**

* Automated remediation of issues found by SonarQube.
* Scanning of branches other than `main`.
* Complex Quality Gate configuration within SonarQube (initial setup will use SonarQube defaults).
* User interface development beyond what Gitea, Jenkins, and SonarQube provide.
* Performance tuning beyond reasonable defaults for the sample project.
* Advanced security hardening of the containers beyond standard practices for a local demo environment.
* Notifications (email, Slack, etc.).
* Use of Kubernetes or any orchestrator other than Docker Compose.
* Migration of existing data into these new instances.

**8. Functional Requirements (FR):**

* **FR1:** The system MUST provide a `docker-compose.yml` file to launch Gitea, Jenkins, and SonarQube services.
* **FR2:** Upon first launch, Gitea, Jenkins, and SonarQube MUST be configurable (e.g., admin setup).
* **FR3:** The Gitea instance MUST host a sample repository (`admin/django-sample-app`) pre-populated with a basic Python/Django application and a `sonar-project.properties` file.
* **FR4:** The Gitea sample repository MUST be configured with a webhook to notify Jenkins on commits to the `main` branch.
* **FR5:** Jenkins MUST securely store and use a Gitea access token to clone the sample repository.
* **FR6:** Jenkins MUST securely store and use a SonarQube authentication token to publish scan results.
* **FR7:** Upon detection of a new commit to `main` in the Gitea sample repository, Jenkins MUST automatically trigger a Declarative Pipeline.
* **FR8:** The Jenkins pipeline MUST checkout the latest code from the `main` branch of the Gitea sample repository.
* **FR9:** The Jenkins pipeline MUST execute a SonarQube scan on the checked-out Python code.
* **FR10:** The SonarQube scan results MUST be published to the SonarQube server, associated with the project key `dev.productivity:django-sample-app`.
* **FR11:** Users MUST be able to view the scan results and analysis on the SonarQube dashboard (accessible via localhost).
* **FR12:** Data for Gitea, Jenkins, and SonarQube MUST persist across container restarts.

**9. Non-Functional Requirements (NFR):**

* **NFR1 (Reliability):** The webhook trigger and Jenkins pipeline execution should be reliable for every commit to `main` on the sample repository.
* **NFR2 (Performance):** The SonarQube scan for the sample Python/Django project should complete within 5 minutes.
* **NFR3 (Maintainability):** The `docker-compose.yml`, `Jenkinsfile`, and `sonar-project.properties` should be well-commented and easy to understand.
* **NFR4 (Security):** Credentials (Gitea token, SonarQube token) MUST be managed securely within Jenkins. Default credentials for services should be documented for the user to change after initial setup. For this demo, services will be exposed on localhost.
* **NFR5 (Usability):** The entire stack should be launchable with a single `docker-compose up` command after initial setup. Clear instructions for initial setup and usage must be provided.
* **NFR6 (Portability):** The solution MUST run on a system with Docker Desktop and Docker Compose installed.
* **NFR7 (Resource Usage):** The combined resource usage (CPU, RAM) should be reasonable for a typical developer machine running Docker Desktop.

**10. Technical Requirements / High-Level Architecture:**

* **Source Control Management:** Gitea (latest stable, containerized).
  * Sample Repository: `adminr/django-sample-app.git`
  * Authentication for Jenkins: Gitea Access Token.
* **CI/CD Orchestrator:** Jenkins (latest stable LTS, containerized).
  * Pipeline Type: Declarative Pipeline (`Jenkinsfile` in Gitea repo).
  * Required Plugins: SonarQube Scanner, Gitea Plugin (or generic Git SCM), necessary credential management plugins.
* **Code Analysis Server:** SonarQube (latest stable Community Edition, containerized).
  * Project Key: `dev.productivity:django-sample-app`
  * Authentication for Jenkins: SonarQube User Token.
* **Code Scanner:** SonarScanner for Python (invoked by Jenkins, likely via SonarQube Scanner plugin). Configuration via `sonar-project.properties`.
* **Project Language & Build:** Python (with `pip`).
* **Containerization Technology:** Docker, Docker Compose.
  * Images: Official images from Docker Hub where possible.
  * Networking: Containers will be networked together via Docker Compose default network. Ports will be mapped to localhost for access.
* **Workflow:**
    1. User runs `docker-compose up`.
    2. User performs initial setup for Gitea, Jenkins, SonarQube (admin users, tokens, webhook, Jenkins job pointing to Gitea repo's Jenkinsfile). *Alternatively, these steps could be scripted or pre-configured in images/entrypoints where feasible.*
    3. Developer commits and pushes Python/Django code (with `sonar-project.properties`) to the `main` branch of `admin/django-sample-app` in Gitea.
    4. Gitea sends a webhook payload to Jenkins.
    5. Jenkins receives the webhook and triggers the Declarative Pipeline defined in the `Jenkinsfile`.
    6. The Jenkins pipeline (running on the Jenkins master container or an ephemeral agent if configured):
        a.  Checks out the source code from Gitea using the Gitea access token.
        b.  Invokes the SonarScanner, using the SonarQube token, project key, and `sonar-project.properties`.
        c.  The SonarScanner analyzes the Python code and uploads the results to SonarQube.
    7. User views the analysis report on the SonarQube server dashboard.

**11. Assumptions:**

* The user has Docker Desktop (or a compatible Docker environment) and Docker Compose installed and running on their local machine.
* Sufficient resources (CPU, RAM, Disk) are available on the local machine for running the three services.
* A simple Python/Django application (or placeholder code) will be provided or generated to populate the Gitea repository. If not provided by the user, Gemini should create a very basic one.
* The user can access services running on `localhost` via a web browser.

**12. Constraints:**

* Must use Gitea, Jenkins, and SonarQube.
* Must use Docker and Docker Compose.
* All components (Gitea, Jenkins, SonarQube) will be new instances set up within containers.
* Focus on a single sample Python/Django repository.
* Use latest stable versions of all tools.

**13. Risks & Mitigation:**

* **Risk:** Complexity in `docker-compose.yml` inter-service dependencies (e.g., Jenkins needing Gitea/SonarQube URLs before they are fully up).
  * **Mitigation:** Use Docker Compose `depends_on` and health checks if necessary; clear documentation on setup order if manual steps are unavoidable.
* **Risk:** Initial setup of Gitea, Jenkins (plugins, credentials), and SonarQube (project, token) can be tedious.
  * **Mitigation:** Provide clear, step-by-step instructions. Explore Jenkins CasC (Configuration as Code) or Groovy init scripts for Jenkins automation if feasible for Gemini. For Gitea/SonarQube, document manual steps or suggest API scripting if Gemini can generate it.
* **Risk:** Correct SonarScanner configuration for Python/Django and `sonar-project.properties` file.
  * **Mitigation:** Start with a minimal `sonar-project.properties` and iterate. Provide a basic example.
* **Risk:** Port conflicts on localhost if user has other services running.
  * **Mitigation:** Document default ports used and how to change them in `docker-compose.yml`.

**14. Success Criteria:**

* The entire Gitea, Jenkins, and SonarQube stack can be successfully launched using a `docker-compose up` command.
* After initial documented setup, a commit to the `main` branch of the sample `admin/django-sample-app` Gitea repository automatically triggers a Jenkins pipeline.
* The Jenkins pipeline successfully checks out code, executes a SonarQube scan, and publishes results to the SonarQube server.
* Scan results for the sample Python project are visible and correct in the SonarQube dashboard under the `dev.productivity:django-sample-app` project.
* Data persists across container restarts for Gitea, Jenkins, and SonarQube.
* Clear documentation is provided for setup, configuration, and usage.

**15. Future Considerations (Optional):**

* Automating the initial setup steps (admin users, tokens, webhooks, Jenkins jobs) via scripting.
* Scanning feature branches or pull requests.
* Enforcing Quality Gates in Jenkins.
* Adding a simple test coverage report generation to the Python app and including it in SonarQube.
